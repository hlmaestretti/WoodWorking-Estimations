# WoodWorking-Estimations
A python package that is meant to optimize the cost and time estimations for woodworking projects.

Currently it can do the following:
- Indicate if a the desired cuts can fit in the wood you have available.
- Indicate how much board feet you need for a project
- Calculate a wood cost estimate.
- Calculate a time estimate for cutting the wood.

## Quick Start
TBD

## Detailed Guide
TBD

## Future Plans
- Create a printout of where each cut should be for canFit.
- Create board objects from a given .stl file (CAD)
- From the .stl file, find the number of joints need to calculate the gluing/joining cost
- Estimate the amount of coating needed for the project
- Create estimators for sanding and joining and update current estimators to be more robust
- Create a better UI for the package
